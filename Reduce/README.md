## REDUCE
REDUCE is simply a class with methods using the `reduce()` method to simplify some very basic operations on array.
`Reduce.sum(array)` is used to get a sum of the numbers inside an array.
`Reduce.flat(array)` is used to flatten an array.
`Reduce.regroup(objectsArray, property)` is used to regroup an array of objects by values of a given property.
`Reduce.count(array, value)` is used to count the number of occurence of a given value in an array.
`Reduce.countArray(array, arrayValues)` is used to count the number of occurence in an array of given values from an array of values. The result is returned as an object with each values occuring more than once as keys, and the number of occurences as values.
`Reduce.countAll(array)` is used to count the number of occurence of each item in an array. The result is returned as an object with each item as keys, and the number of occurences as values.
