## SUDOKU SOLVER  
The SUDOKU SOLVER can be used to solve any grid. I've already made a similar project using Python, but without any visual interface. JavaScript allows me to do that in a simplier way. 

Work in progress:   
It is actually working but I'd like to display the solving in real time.  

This project will be made using basic JavaScript. It is an exercise I decided to do in order to train my skills concerning the interactions with the HTML DOM. It also allows me to get more confortable with JavaScript.  

### Programming language:
JAVASCRIPT
> How long I have been learning this language when the project was started? Around 15 days~
